## Vendor_Performance_Analysis
###🔸 Problem Statement
-  The objective of this project was to evaluate vendor performance by analyzing sales, purchasing, and inventory data to identify profitability drivers, operational inefficiencies, and vendor dependency risks. And finally deliver a clear vendor segmentation framework, actionable recommendations, and ready-to-use datasets for Excel and Power BI reporting.

###🔸 Approach
-  The analysis was conducted in multiple phases:
-  Data cleaning and validation across six operational datasets
-  Creation of vendor-level performance metrics
-  Exploratory analysis to identify revenue, margin, and inventory patterns
-  Statistical testing to validate observed relationships
-  Machine learning classification to identify high- and low-margin vendors
-  Strategic vendor segmentation for decision-making
